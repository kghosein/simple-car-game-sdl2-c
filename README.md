# simple-car-game-sdl2-c
A simple car game build with sdl2 and C. It also uses sdl_image (library).
### How it works?
If the car object (termed as player) collides with the obstacle (termed as enemy), game gets over and closes. In case of no collision, success message gets printed in the console.
Use right arrow key to move forward and up arrow key to jump.
